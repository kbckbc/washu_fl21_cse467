21 Fall semester cse 467 course works at Washington University in St. Louis.

Hey folks!

If you read this file, you may be a student at WashU.
I am also a master's student at McKelvey School of Engineering, entering in 2021.

I found out later that they gave us previous assignments without making any changes and it was kind of a shocker for me. 
(At least they should change some conditions, I think.)
Therefore, I uploaded these works wishing professors not to use previous assignments.

I did my best and tried to solve all the assignments, but they might be wrong.
I did it on my own and sometimes it was painful but I learned many things through figuring them out.
(My solutions are not a perfect score.)

Please don't just copy these solutions and use them as a guide to your work. 
I wish you to learn something from courses at WashU.

If you have any questions and shoot me a email at kbckbc@gmail.com.
As long as I remember these questions, I can help you out.

Good luck!
