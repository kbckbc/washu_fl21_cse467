21 Fall semester CSE 467 course works at Washington University in St. Louis.

Hey folks!

If you read this file, you may be a student at WashU. I am also a master's student at McKelvey School of Engineering, entering in 2021.

I enjoyed the courses but I found out later that some courses gave us previous assignments without making any changes and it was kind of a shocker for me. Therefore, I uploaded these works to share with you wishing not to use previous assignments again.

I did my best and tried to solve all the assignments, but the solutions might be wrong (My solutions are not a perfect score). I did it on my own and sometimes it was painful but I learned many things through figuring them out.

Please don't just copy these solutions and use them as a guide to your work. I wish you to learn something from courses at WashU.

If you have any questions and shoot me a email at kbckbc@gmail.com. As long as I remember these questions, I can help you out.

Good luck!
